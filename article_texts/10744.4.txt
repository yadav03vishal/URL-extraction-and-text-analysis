title : machine replace human future work ? - blackcoffer insights disruptive technology taking us ? take leave , disruptive technology always creates new jobs much depleted jobs . might notice certain jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots , machines , technology creating machines replace . technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence ( ai ) , big data machine learning ( ml ) algorithms predict drive consumer behavior . data analytics tools , google analytics , others available today free , , used correctly , help organizations save millions , maybe billions dollars sales marketing . go , think ’ best level set constitutes machines . context article , machines describe computers computerized equipment , like robots , programmed learn , sometimes like humans . occasionally call artificial intelligence ( ai ) , times call machine learning , still times call robotics . yes , technically different things . bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day . really tough tasks considered difficult human . , within broad discussion related future work , totally interrelated . factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside . machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily . every forward step & advancement technology , threat proliferating , threat replaced work front . every passing day sealing jobs humans globe . similarly , ai used turn hand-drawn sketches ( done humans ) digital source code . companies clearly developing ai robotics expertise idea technological innovations ’ able course , ’ machines creatives working together either . another example , amazon employed 100,000 robots warehouses efficiently move things around increased warehouse workforce 80,000. humans , amazon ’ case , picking packing goods robots move orders around giant warehouses , essentially cutting “ walking required workers , making amazon pickers efficient less tired. ” plus , robots “ allow amazon pack shelves together like cars rush-hour traffic longer need aisle space humans . greater density shelf space means inventory one roof , means better selection customers. ” next decades ( maybe sooner ) , notion work whether handled human virtual hinge predictability . starting today , machines manage routine humans take unpredictable – tasks require creativity , problem-solving , flexibility . context , robotics seen means improve operations efficiency also improve quality life workers . although obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation , also true highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal robots . besides greater efficiency speed , automation leads lower risk accidents , greater control autonomy , , fewer costs organizations . although artificial intelligence machine learning make us believe robots endowed superior intelligence , fact ’ yet ability learn experience respond unknowns . things stand , however much processing speed automatic learning robot , ’ beat factors innate human brain . humans still essential part process . think delivering services client . customer challenges routine , humans play important role addressing new issues , solving first time appear , consolidating process system . machines humans placed proximity , robots expensive , ’ apply types , especially based robotic process automation ( rpa ) , development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs . moreover , think domestic robots—be vacuum cleaner , lawn mower pool cleaner—are increasingly part daily lives . level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control , security comfort . division humans machines clear – ’ , machine – boundary getting fuzzier . smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies , making lost limbs providing additional strength , stability , resilience , seen exoskeletons donned assembly line workers . use smartphones symbiotically , integrated directly bodies ? think smartphone form contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images straight brain . think sounds like science fiction ? think . first prototypes already built . soon , brain-computer interfaces could become seamless well , creating new synergistic relationship cloud us . point , question knows would moot ; ask question know answer . sometimes answer stored neural circuitry , time would come connection neurons web . brain ’ decision process influenced way “ educated ” cultural context . external factors influencing decision processes point certain situations , legitimately claim influence strong brains ’ held accountable choices made . point ’ trying make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools – physical conceptual – taught use . guess transformation subtle . practically speaking , robots growing point take world start creating smarter , better robots impractical even concern . none expected near future , long shot . ’ atm , waited pc boot catastrophic failure , game crash x box reach checkpoint , understand world machines everything perfectly right . take jobs , need able ’ flawlessly ; , depend humans mess lives . ’ win-or-lose situation . ’ going wind partner smarter machines , partnership fostered augmentation technology . machines play essential role augmentation , successful technology , fall level perception . end , revolution silent invisible .
