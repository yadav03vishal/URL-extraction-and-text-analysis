title : machine replace human future work ? - blackcoffer insights “ anything could give rise smarter-than-human intelligence – form artificial intelligence , brain-computer interfaces , neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands beyond contest change world . nothing else even league. ” –eliezer yudkowsky , ai researcher ’ denying robots automation increasingly part daily lives . look around grocery store , highway , everywhere . makes us wonder ai replace human intelligence ? make relevant tomorrow ? let us try find answers questions . let ’ first understand artificial intelligence – artificial intelligence ai basically machines displaying intelligence . seen machine playing chess robot answering questions facebook . artificial intelligence broken many different types . ais designed specific tasks , detecting specific type cancer . however , also ais multiple tasks , driving car . many types ais . among top , important fields machine learning ml , neural network , computer vision , natural language processing nlp . machine learning idea machines able prove similar human learns new skill . machine learning also allows optimization existing skill . machine learning used many different fields one application entertainment . netflix uses machine learning recommend shows watch based shows already seen . neural networks algorithms modeled human brain . algorithms think like thereby give similar results human give . artificial neural networks used medical fields diagnose cancers like lung cancer prostate cancer . computer vision idea computers visions . allows see things way human beings potentially better human beings , depending programming , camera used , etc . computer vision used autonomous vehicles navigation one place another . natural language processing idea computers listen say . example siri . siri able listen demands , process means , provide answer based researched . know ai , let ’ talk issue . ais allow automation jobs , thereby replacing humans already . means job loss concentration wealth selected people . could mean destabilization society social unrest . addition social unrest , ai improves time . means becomes smarter , faster , cheaper implement better repetitive things humans currently , preparing fast food . predicted ai improve much 50 100 years ai become super intelligent . means become even smarter intelligent human earth . according many experts elon musk , could cause end human civilization . ai could potentially start war humans , burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions . point , theory , stop ai would already thought obstacles prevent goal . means unplug machine , effect ai replace human intelligence . , happen next 10 30 years ? ! field artificial intelligence sophisticated enough many human tasks humans currently . currently , ai smart enough empathetic humans think strategically enough solve complex problems . ai solutions expensive go many different tests standards implement . also takes time ai improve . example , boston dynamics , one world ’ top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk . fast forward 2019 , robot could walk could jump objects , backflips much . addition timing , takes time price new technological solution drop point affordable . example , desktop computer costs around $ 1000 1999 get significantly powerful laptop exact price . ai go curve . happens 10 30 years ? ai make human intelligence obsolete ? maybe . proven earlier ai become faster better cheaper . happens , companies use ai technology automate jobs save money , increase productivity , importantly , stay competitive . demonstrated , ai become better repetition via use machine learning . difference ai able learn faster time progresses due amount data available today . also able learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks new important skills . however , ai also repetitive routine tasks better , also able understand emotional intelligence , ethics , creativity . seen three distinct example- ibm ibm uses ibm watson program ai create movie trailer . fox approached ibm said movie coming ai scifi horror . asked ibm platform ibm watson could trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary , sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions quantifiable manner . ibm watson able generate trailer movie morgan . result , movie trailer created machines example – google 2018 google demonstrated ai assistance could take calls simple stuff . ai able set appointment ! fascinating able understand nuances conversation . receptionist thought human calling . primitive version possible technology . eventually , able conversations human beings , making many sales jobs obsolete . example – ai generated art 2018 , paris art collective consisting three students used artificial intelligence generate portrait . generated portrait painting studying set fifteen thousand art images wiki art . estimated worth seven thousand ten thousand dollars . painting sold auction four thirty-five thousand us dollars . however , sure say ai replace human intelligence . society started asking hard questions questioning ethics . elon musk founded open ai , research lab whose whole purpose promote discover artificial intelligence way benefits humanity . addition , many factors affect long-term outcome ai replacing human intelligence . like , degree humans allow ai take ? depending field , people even want artificial intelligence help ? prefer human counterpart ? may able control happens long run , definitely secure short-term future . strategic creative thinking ability think outside box human . thousands upon thousands slightly different possible outcomes may result every distinguishable action human mind ability judge experience programmed purposes far sophisticated manner ai currently achieve . billionaire founder alibaba , jack famously said – “ ai logic , human beings wisdom ” . conflict resolution negotiations understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge , far better equipped deal conflicts robots ever likely . ai may able recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces . humans , lesser greater degrees , capable accurate analysis emotional subtext . application intuition use delicately worded elusive languages , methods , able properly judge person feels . interpretation gray areas robots computers function well presented quantifiable data . however , situation enters gray area , whether term refers morals , processes , definitions robots likely falter . critical thinking humans capable responding indicators quality computers . ai system may able analyze documents according true false statements made within text , judge whether well written analyze implication use certain words overall meaning content .
