title : data analytics ai used halt covid-19 pandemic ? - blackcoffer insights even though covid-19 yet halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak across several countries , notably us , india , brazil . fact data analytics ai big guns artillery fight covid-19 pandemic . helped us several stages outbreak , like detection first outbreak , vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing , future hotspot detection . interesting applications discussed article . lesser-known fact covid-19 outbreak first detected toronto , canada , nearly 7,230 miles away first outbreak , nine days issued warning . help big data analytics ai , specifically deep learnings ( dl , subset machine learning ) application natural language processing ( nlp ) analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases wuhan province china . specialty dl algorithms mimic brain cells called neurons identify patterns big data . dl-backed software used inputs , reports public health organizations , global airline ticketing data , etc . used flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases . next application big data analytics ai research development drugs halt covid-19 . ai used analyze protein structure virus , findings significant progress vaccine development . preliminary studies , found mutate fast viruses hiv , means prophylactic vaccine better way proceed rather therapy . also evidence supporting fact find kind cure , chance virus mutating , happened major mutations found uk , brazil , south africa . ai also assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting set already available vaccines could effective coronavirus . another interesting application ai found selection right candidates , i.e . likely test positive testing coronavirus case insufficient testing resources . method first exercised greek borders called project eva . whenever traveler wanted come greece , fill form known passenger locator form ( plf ) least 24 hours prior arrival , containing information origin country , demographics , point , date entry , intended destination . eva allocated testing resources according size set passengers tested . test results , found positive , put quarantine . results sent back program real-time learning . question remains eva made allocations , found , statistically , origin country city significant factors screening . ultimately , variety countries city pairs , eva predict many testing resources allocated entry point particular passengers location technically called multi-armed bandit ( mab ) problem , chosen method solve problem ai algorithm called optimistic gittins index . algorithm identified average 1.85x many asymptomatic , infected travelers random surveillance testing , 2-4x many peak travel . test results , found positive , put quarantine . following collection significant data aforementioned process , certain period , policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location . eva presented operation august 6th november 1st processing around 38,500 plfs day testing average 18.5 % households entering country every day . mentioned applications show tip iceberg get developments watch include use image recognition identify covid based x-ray images , use deep learning predict 3-d protein structure associated covid-19 .
