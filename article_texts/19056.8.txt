title : ai machine learning statistics data mining - difference “ data new oil ” become important trendline 21st century . reason advancements fields related data analysis . field ai machine learning statistics data mining deal data developing staggering pace , fields become popular buzzwords days . buzzwords originated technical terms often underlying essence ignored fashionable use mainly used impress . main reason misconception amongst people . ai , ml , stats , data mining , many fields related analysis data often mistook one thing , thus words often used interchangeably convey one thing . true ! similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “ information ” . academics , learning ai machine learning statistics data mining , academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored , case articles try explain difference . thus , becoming primary cause confusion learners . hence , article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitions . essential difference disciplines lies “ aims ” approach taken achieve aims . aim artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . satisfy aim , must first understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? answer questions found studying intelligent agents best example intelligent agent found standing front mirror ! yes ! humans best examples intelligent entities . thus , 1900s , researchers began exploring thought process , reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . mimicking human behavior became aim ai initial years research . setting goal , studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim turing test ! turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks , sufficient fool interrogator . test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence . intelligence related working human brain without human brain , intelligence meaning ! thus , mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim . field psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process . difference ai tries understand thought process mimic , build . collaboration fields resulted models neural networks try mimic function neurons present human brain . , basically , initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent . concurrently , field computer science developing greater pace . advances computer science , experiments theories could easily tested validated . programs applied solve real-life problems , found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans . one best examples could chess-playing program . ai program defeated world ’ best chess player garry kasparov . incident indicated human intelligence ultimate intelligence else human would able defeat ai program . leads question , human intelligence ideal intelligence ? computers became advanced , proved better humans certain complex tasks . new definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems . , rather considering nature agents , researchers began study nature intelligence . question comes test validate intelligence ? best way test intelligence solve cognitive problems . agent said intelligent solve complex problem . problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers . thus , researchers began studying ideal intelligence , selected agent validate experiments computer . , computer problem-solving approach adopted . , human-centered approach computer , problem-solving approach two main aims ai . fields contributed field giving valuable insights . aims important collaboratively form main aim ai ! problem-solving approach , big challenge ai overcome order achieve aim . consider example solving math problem . two cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach . let us say two math problems given solve . first problem familiar second problem . consider first problem . first problem familiar , means know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past . , comes question , mind able solve problem ? answer , solved similar problems past , thus learned past data , solve problems , thus even ’ seen problem past , still able solve similar problems . one form intelligence . consider another case given second problem solved kind problems past . solve problem , try consciously gather manipulate given information reach certain conclusion . kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . second kind intelligence . ai build intelligent agents , kinds intelligence must developed agent . , reality ai reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information . ai today reached point build agents think . second type intelligence . , way ai able implement first type intelligence machine learning ! , domain ai focuses solely implementing first kind intelligence fact machine learning . reason ml called subset ai ! , main difference ai ml . technically speaking , “ field study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions , patterns without explicitly programmed ” . statement needs elaboration . essence ml related process “ generalization ” learning past data . generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . consider humans recognize daily life objects . see animal , easily recognize “ dog ” “ cat ” . trivial task us ever wondered mind able ? answer generalization ! given picture dog , easily recognize picture dog , , minds abstracted description dog formulated “ concept ” dog concepts became better better learned past experiences dog . , way think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds . generalization , come real “ information ” . , try give computers ability generalize “ raw data ” convert “ information ” patterns trends data . discipline concerns collection , organization , analysis , interpretation , presentation data . statistics tries deal data aim explain . , study explaining data ! statistics two main domains descriptive statistics inferential statistics . descriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name “ descriptive ” statistics . tries explain much information possible , easily whole large data would complex task otherwise . inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available small data . use inference many tasks daily lives . consider simple case cooking soup . completing recipe , taste small sample , , spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad . depending upon result sample , make inference whole soup soup whole , good bad . similarly , statistics , cases apply inference meaningful information . example , consider case gather whole data time-consuming costly . cases , applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty . inferential statistics come help . , use data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals . , however , whatever data , statistics tries explain data . aim resonate ai ml , statistics help fields correctly interpret data ! “ data ” , useful raw form . consider examples sensors used industrial applications . sensors might used manufacturing plant sense different properties like temperature , pressure , etc . raw data generated sensors useful unless converted suitable form , processed , analyzed gather valuable insights , used solve problem ! due unique aim capturing essence large datasets , gather insights , data mining also referred “ knowledge discovery ” . , carly fiorina , former ceo hewlett-packard said , “ goal turn data information information insight ” . statement completely explains aim data mining ! , difference ai machine learning statistics data mining lies aims . approaches taken fields , help one way fulfilling aims fields . beauty fields !
