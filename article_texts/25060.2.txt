title : ever colonize outer space ? - blackcoffer insights nature blessed humanity earth , rounded globe essential necessity lies hand human . though 21st-century building space shuttle exploring space become obvious activity among human raise , inclusion start-ups like space x dreamed reaching space coming true . agree upon fact growth industrialization generated humungous carbon footprint colonize outer space create much-needed area survival . time human race visualized undergone many transformations , transformations may starters effective major role existence age . natural transformation like shifting tectonic plates manmade like dumping water damaging water bodies , somehow affected usual life humans creating space humans next humans eyeing . idea colonizing outer space emerged nasa able launch space shuttle heavy payload late 1990s idea ’ stir brain time later like apple eyes various articles astronauts writeup came limelight idea saw progression , space exploration new normal , companies petrified number investments kinds projects ask . things change entry paypal ’ owner elon musk , 2002 laid stones space x , nasa providing launchpad exploration . space travel legitimate many bottlenecks knowing nature outer space boost idea colonizing , one realize optimum . main target company put forward themself get planet get back earth safely , earlier projects due high fund always subdued priority given rocket technology . thus , unimaginable quest search space far-fetched though . 2020 find place colonizing outside space , kind emergence technologies led escalation spreading roots human existence , plan reaching outer space plays key role idea . proper planning , analysing , organising , executing required projects successful deeper know would like mention example space x , according wud successful sending rockets 2022 would able colonize 2050 , achieving vision planned total 36 times pre-launch rocket launching 2020. already placed star link satellites provide basic network connectivity colonized world , planned extent targeted profit $ 22 billion yearly 2025. already sent first manned rocket successfully elon musk plan create infrastructure going mars cost regular air flight ticket lead better chances colonizing another planet . setting commercial flight started red planet wud stepping stone colonizing outer space . fundamental change people undergo living another planet change gravity able near live support technical issues arise suit unless find similar place like earth change humans adjust . aspects like ultraviolet rays play immense role survival , rate technology expanding challenging boundaries many days left find solutions aspects idea colonizing monetary terms projected building colony space cost $ 10 trillian many countries gdp . placing much amount getting funding highly anticipated projects tough . elon addressed questions open door believes cost nothing find route colonize space costs justifiable space exploration reach new heights . also , world around water percentage land comparison water less . whereas population increasing speed level excitement order search new things obsession new innovative things never going finish . end , satisfy achieved , looking things crave achieve . order achieve planning crucial stage . searched 9 planets still ’ shortlisted outcomes . according 3-decade theory elon musk , seems possible . important thing survive atmospheric environment , whether suitable , order make suitable steps take maintain suitable level oxygen . missions everyone focusing . finding source water , 2nd crucial thing needed survive . apart excitement things , threats uncertainties bound happen like kind mammal could occur construction . security protection uncertainties could replicated . basic things , factors like natural habitats available , whether plants could grown . yes , types plants could survive . environment animals safe . balance nature need types animals , natural habitat , even insects small things seems ignorable plays important role maintaining environmental balance . e.g . – ants among leading predators insects , helping keep pest populations low . ants move approximately amount soil earthworms , loosening soil process increasing air water movement ground . keep ecosystem clean dead insect carcasses aid destruction decomposition plant animal matter . , every small thing contributes way . another matter concern level artificial intelligence machine learning required maintain kind requirement . current scenario , need energy run vehicle even robotics . , availability energy source energy needed . apart , heat sun equally important order maintain level . artificial air survive long . , order remain healthy well calculation done . thinking disease , may heard news concern antibiotics ( penicillin ) – help fight infections – may eventually stop working . global health organisations trying reduce use antibiotics , especially conditions ’ serious . overuse recent years means ’ becoming less effective . still survive without antibiotics . ways dealing diseases caused bacteria isolation treated penicillin . might sound like something set firmly realm fantasy , experts private industry governments around world trying understand feasible would establish lunar base . scientists think humans could survive comfortably moon . ways , minimal gravity moon might actually conducive life microgravity astronauts experience international space station . although ’ formally tested , experts hypothesize small amount gravitational force put astronaut ’ body moon could help stem adverse effects like bone-density muscle loss space flyers experience living microgravity international space station . using moon ’ indigenous material , space agencies save money cost flying pricey missions moon ’ surface . moon , instead stage costly missions aimed delivering oxygen necessary resources earth , experts might able actually use material manufacture gasses needed sustain life satellite . earth , protected radioactive solar winds cosmic rays magnet field known magnetosphere . space , ’ rely type protection , order make protection , could take lot yes upgraded technology could achieve . although till approximate value project $ 10 trillion . aim make fare equivalent normal air fare . comfortable resources , securities uncertainties , risk analysis , probability survival human many factors consideration , development ’ take much time . construct building take normally 8-9 months . totally acceptable . main concern density land , i.e . whether land capacity bear much weight . type land adaptable cultivation . although land converted different types cultivation help upgraded technology . order transport equipments regular basis , large amount fuel required , factors well built propellor depo rocket landing building various infrastructure city one one create way forward idea colonizing outer space .
