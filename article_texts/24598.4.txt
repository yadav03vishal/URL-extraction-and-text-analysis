title : ever understand nature consciousness ? - blackcoffer insights introduction definition consciousness controversial centuries , hence given title ‘ familiar yet mysterious aspects lives ’ . idea concept would awareness beings surroundings , , perception . reason part mind remains unascertained consciousness ’ observable , unlike brain matter studied scientifically . physical clarification awareness general sense incomplete : ’ include feels subject , subject . likewise accounts unbridgeable illustrative gap physical world consciousness . suggested incident eastern shamir traditions , consciousness universal primal . whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years , research ’ able answer questions relating nature emotions experiences . history beginning within late nineteenth century , time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind , typically equated consciousness . result , analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain . ancient mayans among first propose sorted feeling degree consciousness , purpose , worldly association mankind . since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature well interior stimuli , mayans trusted essential type existence , equipped evolution . incas , however , thought consciousness movement mindfulness well worry others . john locke , early philosopher , said consciousness , individuality , freelanced substances . also detected reason believe consciousness stuck specific body mind , consciousness transferred one body mind different one . karl marx , another early thinker , denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one ’ settings . william james , american psychologist , differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous despite several changes shifts . main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors throughout primary half twentieth century , analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s . sigmund freud ’ psychoanalytic theory , see believed three levels awareness- preconscious , conscious , unconscious responsible one ’ behavior thinking . believed mid divided three parts- id , ego , superego . id present birth , instinctual , operates according pleasure principle . ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy . finally , superego internalization society ’ moral standards responsible guilt . , id regarded unconscious , whereas ego superego also conscious preconscious . freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches , however , ’ conduct scientific experiments hence work heavily scrutinized , leaving questions unanswered . sigmund freud ’ theory differed psychologists since theories understandable easily conveyed people . sigmund freud ’ work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth , character , memory , sexuality , therapy . however , theories subject considerable criticism life . whilst john locke william james took practical approach mystery conducting experiments , sigmund freud ’ provide evidence support claims . brain today , essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally . issues interest include phenomena perception , blindsight , brainwaves sleep , altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs . greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters . however , confirm criticalness verbal reports , researchers must contrast action happens brain —that , search neural connections consciousness . hope locate noticeable action specific aspect brain , particular pattern global brain activity , greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness . brain imaging strategies , example , eeg mri scans , utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations . investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain ’ adequate create consciousness : workable subjects report absence awareness event , areas , example , primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus . higher brain areas viewed encouraging , particularly prefrontal cortex , involved range high order functions . one mainstream theory implicates various examples brain waves creating various conditions consciousness . analysts record mind waves , drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum , using electroencephalograph ( eeg ) placing electrodes scalp . four types brain waves ( alpha , beta , theta , delta ) correspond one mental state ( relaxed , alert , lightly asleep , deeply asleep ) memory episodic memory regarded form conscious memory . capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past . hippocampus located brain ’ temporal lobe responsible type memory . consciousness also plays part important memory distinctions . one distinction implicit explicit characteristics ; explicit memory consciously know implicit memory includes events may conscious . furthermore , several empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well ; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness . working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information well since temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks . current ways testing information lacking several essential aspects , including spatial resolution , temporal resolution , scope . examples methods pet , fmri , eeg , implanted electrodes , etc . pet fmri temporal resolution problems , eeg well-known localizability difficulties , implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons ; , restricted scope . hence , huge numbers speculations , testable fundamental level , appear difficult test . mental illness consciousness influence way see objects around us , encourages us settle choices communicate . experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems , example , agnosia ( failure decipher visual data ) , alzheimer ’ disease , autism . however , actually ’ comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object . several different disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome , minimally conscious state , persistent vegetative state , chronic coma , brain death . locked-in syndrome , otherwise called pseudo coma , condition wherein patient aware however ’ move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body aside vertical eye developments squinting . individual conscious able speak eye movements . minimally conscious state , patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness . patients need give restricted , however reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance . could following straightforward orders , comprehensible speech , purposeful conduct . persistent vegetative state , patient sleep-wake cycles , lacks awareness , able communicate , displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior . term refers organic body able grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse like coma , chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury , central brainstem sores . usually , metabolism grey matter decreases 50-70 % normal range . patient lies eyes shut ’ know self environmental factors . brain death irreversible end brain activity , function ( including involuntary activity necessary sustain life ) . main cause total necrosis cerebral neurons following loss brain oxygenation . brain death patient lacks sense awareness ; sleep-wake cycles behavior , typically look dead deep sleep state . future predictions conclusion see history scholar ’ endeavors study consciousness empirically , nature one defined using scientific methods . past , psychologists descartes came dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics . battle realists illusionists , taking sides fundamentally impossible topic ’ allow concrete evidence . observe neural examinations brain detect causes consciousness , sensory sector brain cause one aware certain event even clear signs reaction stimulus . similarly , even though consciousness plays major role memory , currently lack facilities research fully . future , possibility able access facilities , however , could allow us find neural connections ties mental illness well . would help several people making us aware causes perspective certain things , would also give us better chance recognizing signs possible mental illness issues beforehand . seems , researchers continue study unknown part mind able fund recover global pandemic , able answer one psychology ’ difficult questions .
