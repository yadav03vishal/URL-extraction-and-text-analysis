title : artificial intelligence affect environment - blackcoffer insights talk ai , different people different perspectives . one group people , good knowledge real potential ai , believe ai novel solution many problems world facing today . another group people merely threatened thought ai taking world . field ai took birth alan turing 1950 thought “ machines think ? ” . later 1980s , adoption “ expert systems ” companies around world , booming field ai initiated . initially , matter awe everyone see results ai achieve . ai ’ growth past decades exponential transformed way live , work solve challenges . ai made impact wide variety areas including healthcare , education , business many . , one areas highest impact ai made recently environment climate change . ai revolutionizing way deal environment climate change ? ai strengthen climate predictions , enable smarter decision-making decarbonising industries building transport , work allocate renewable energy . recent years , ai game-changer many people , well organizations , deal climate change . microsoft believes artificial intelligence , often encompassing machine learning deep learning , “ game-changer ” climate change environmental issues . company ’ ‘ ai earth ’ program committed $ 50 million five years create test new applications ai . ai increasingly used manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid ; handle power fluctuations improve energy storage well . wind companies using ai get turbine ’ propeller produce electricity per rotation incorporating real-time weather operational data . ai also improve energy efficiency city scale incorporating data smart meters internet things ( internet computing devices embedded everyday objects , enabling send receive data ) forecast energy demand . besides , artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws , building ordinances , flood plains help urban planning disaster preparedness . one vision sustainable city create “ urban dashboard ” consisting real-time data energy water use availability , traffic weather make cities energy-efficient livable . hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well . data sensors field monitor crop moisture , soil composition temperature help ai improve production know crops need watering . incorporating information drones , also used monitor conditions , help increasingly automatic ai systems know best times plant , spray harvest crops , head diseases problems . result increased efficiency , enhanced yields , lower use water , fertilizer pesticides . , ai good looks downside ? talk effect ai environment climate , sides coin must elucidated . , apart positives discussed , usage ai also downside . last year ’ world economic forum report showed ai address earth ’ environmental challenges , important manage properly . according forum experts field , ai potential accelerate environmental degradation . use power-intensive gpus run machine learning training already cited contributing increased c02 emissions . although ai around half century , question environmental impact – ethical issues – arising techniques developed decades used combination explosion data strong computational power . advances enabled artificial intelligence , speech recognition self-driving cars , ai systems consume lot power generate high volumes climate-changing carbon emissions . study last year found training off-the-shelf ai language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds emissions – amount produced flying one person roundtrip new york san francisco . ways make machine learning cleaner greener , movement called “ green ai. ” algorithms less power-hungry others , example , many training sessions moved remote locations get power renewable sources . key , however , ai developers companies know much machine learning experiments spewing much volumes could reduced . done ? prevent , proposition world economic forum report advancements “ safe ” ai pursued , ensure humanity developing ai harmful environment . specifically , world economic forum said report ai developers “ must incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension. ” means safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources beyond sustainable , among factors . sense , programs need designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind . future development ai programs , also important note environmental impact creating systems first place . according academic study energy usage deep learning processes , creation effective ai might costly environment . nearly 300,000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model . basically equal emissions five average cars united states . considering negative environmental impact addition positive implications ai climate change crucial , moving forward . always room improvement , pioneers machine learning recently published paper called tackling climate change machine learning discussed major ai conference . david rolnick , postdoctoral fellow university pennsylvania said “ call arms ” means bring researchers together . paper covers thirteen areas research machine learning used , including energy production , co2 removal , education , solar geoengineering , finance many . main idea build energy-efficient buildings , creating new low-carbon materials , high tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources . artificial intelligence machine learning medium real work done us caretaker mother earth . better forecasting climate change ? kick start already done climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science climate science . covers wide range topics like improving prediction extreme events hurricanes , paleoclimatology , collecting data ice cores , climate up-down scaling impact us . “ ’ lot uncertainty , ” monteleoni claire monteleoni , computer science professor university colorado concludes ai/ ml models generally forecast short-term . significant difference comes long-term forecasting . first system developed princeton 1960s . ai/ ml models developed till revolve around atmosphere , oceans , land , cryosphere ice . ai help achieve new heights amount data collected point time , compute complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms . showing effects extreme weather ? know climate change real rise atmospheric temperature proof , make realistic , montreal institute learning algorithms ( mila ) , microsoft conscientai labs uses generative adversarial networks popularly know gans simulate mother earth look like rising sea levels , atmospheric temperature , air pollution intensive storms . “ goal convince people climate change real , ’ get people believe real , ” said victor schmidt , co-author paper ph.d. candidate mila project deployed people look places look like future significant climate change . track carbon emissions ? short answer , yes . tracking carbon emission one agendas un . year 2020 , un ’ goal prevent new coal plants built . satellite images come picture using deep learning techniques , data science researchers analyze high quality satellite images track emission . google expanding horizon nonprofit ’ satellite imagery , including gas-powered plants emissions used researchers track pollution . countries organizations govern co2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations . ai automate analysis images power plants get regular updates emissions . also introduces new ways measure plant ’ impact , crunching numbers nearby infrastructure electricity use . ’ beneficial gas-powered plants ’ easy-to-measure plumes coal-powered plants .
