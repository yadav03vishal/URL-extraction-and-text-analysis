title : coronavirus impact energy markets - blackcoffer insights coronavirus , also known covid-19 , global public health emergency also source significant regional increasingly global economic disruption . impacts energy climate world many ways . economic downturn puts pressure global oil prices leading organization petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) consider cuts production . hurts demand natural gas time extremely low prices . changes economic , energy , climate policymaking environment china , one consequential energy consumers sources greenhouse gas emissions . temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout energy industry , including renewable energy , time supply chain connections china revaluated due ongoing tariff trade disputes . consequential transformative changes energy sector climate efforts depend upon ultimate trajectory virus outbreak — sarah ladislaw , senior vice president director , energy security climate change program energy sector already felt impacts coronavirus . outbreak contributed dampened demand oil , resulting plummeting oil prices production declines . move forward , , energy sector expects face two headwinds : managing issues health emergency sectors face , simultaneously coping low oil-price scenario , lower demand need shore revenue manage debt obligations . impact covid-19 indian energy markets india , distribution utilities lower tariff domestic agricultural consumers , sometimes even average cost supply , compared commercial industrial consumers . table 1 provides electricity tariff rates delhi selected consumer categories highlight differences . thus , several distribution companies , lower tariff-paying consumers cross-subsidized commercial industrial consumers . covid-19 lockdown led shut essential commercial activities across country . approximately 1.3 billion citizens obliged remain within confines homes , many cases , allowed work home . consequently , electricity demand industrial , commercial customers reduced significantly residential demand expected increased . according power system operation corporation india ( posoco ) , energy met march 16th , 2020 – considered business-as-usual scenario – 3494 mu compared 3113 mu march 23rd , 2020 day voluntary curfew . reduced range 2600-2800 mu march 25th march 31st , 2020. trend illustrated figure 1. thus , firstly , key risk covid-19 pandemic already struggling distribution companies india arises loss revenues due reduction demand commercial industrial customers well inability cover cross-subsidies provided lower-tariff paying consumer . secondly , utilities would also account expense comply ‘ must buy ’ commitments generators long-term power purchase agreements . true full extent risk would known quantitative analysis conducted crisis situation contained . thirdly , operational level , distribution companies would account deviation demand supply patterns temporal locational level . finally , period , critical infrastructure electricity networks would run minimum employees . seen figure 1 , trade wholesale power market comprises 4.3 percent total electricity transactions . however , transactions power exchanges grown last decade . indian energy exchange ( iex ) seen growth 2616 mu fy 2009 52,241 fy 2019. , trade wholesale market four market segments : 1 ) day-ahead market 2 ) term ahead market 3 ) renewable energy certificates 4 ) energy-saving certificates . recently , central electricity regulatory commission ( cerc ) finalized regulations implementing real-time markets . half-hourly market enable intra-day trade electricity , allowing adjustment generation consumption profile day . covid-19 pandemic , announced cerc real-time market would operational april 1st , 2020. however , starting date delayed two months june 1st , 2020. according media reports , due covid-19 pandemic , required trials could completed . delay real-time market implementation likely serious , adverse impact indian power market . another impact covid-19 pandemic power markets terms market dynamic . observed dip clearing volume market-clearing price , coincides gradually increasing shutdown measures taken government response covid-19 ( see figure 2 ) . thus , reduction demand due lockdown reflected volumes traded electricity market clearing price . another point reference price clearing volume 2019. march 22nd , 2020 , day voluntary lockdown , clearing volume 97.05 gwh , clearing price 2195.48 ₹ /mwh . comparison , day 2019 , clearing volume 107.98 gwh , clearing price 2816.18 ₹ /mwh . start lockdown , march 25nd april 1st 2020 , average clearing volume 104.27 gwh compared 130.24 gwh 2019 period . similarly , average market clearing price 2155.93 ₹ /mwh 2020 compared 3371.025 ₹ /mwh 2019 period . views shareholders india lockdown resulted shutdown industrial commercial establishments stoppage passenger railway services . adversely impacted india electricity demand , given segments constitute 40 % india electricity demand , statement issued rating firm said . , segments account even greater percentage discoms sales revenues given subsidizing segments . apart , focus state governments healthcare relief measures , likelihood subsidy support discoms getting deferred ruled , added . icra ratings group head senior vice president – corporate ratings sabyasachi majumdar said , “ lockdown imposed government likely adversely impact india electricity demand , demand expected decline 20-25 % year-on-year basis period lockdown . would turn adversely impact revenues cash collections distribution utilities near term , especially given consumption decline high tariff paying industrial commercial consumers likely delays cash collections consumer segments . revenue deficit discoms estimated rs . 130 billion per month , india basis . would turn adversely impact liquidity profile discoms , increase subsidy requirement , lead delays payments power generation transmission companies. ” power ministry friday issued directors central electricity regulatory commission provide moratorium three months discoms payments power generation transmission companies . power ministry friday issued directors central electricity regulatory commission provide moratorium three months discoms payments power generation transmission companies requested state governments issue similar directions state electricity regulators . power generation companies already suffering delays payments discoms across majority states , payment due rs 85000 crore november 2019 india level per data praapti portal . covid-19 lockdown accentuating delays payments , availability adequate liquidity buffer form debt service reserve undrawn working capital limits remains important credit perspective . however , said relief measures moratorium debt servicing 3-month period notified reserve bank india expected moderation interest rate cycle would source comfort near term . timely approval moratorium boards banks financial institutions remains crucial . revenues power generation companies long-term power purchase agreements ( ppas ) state distribution utilities ( discoms ) protected provision capacity charges linked plant availability case thermal large hydropower projects “ must-run ” status case nuclear renewable power projects.average monthly thermal plf would dip 50-52 % 63 % corresponding period previous year , due considerable drop demand consequently , power generation companies especially without long-term ppas would adversely impacted given weakening power tariffs short-term / power exchange market , said icra ratings sector head & vice president girishkumarkadam.the under-construction renewable power projects well epc manufacturing companies solar segment likely face execution delays disruption supply chain india labor availability , following lockdown . given import dependency china sourcing pv modules , execution timelines ongoing solar projects likely affected delays delivery pv modules following outbreak covid 19 china . delay turn would increase pre-operative expenses overall project cost , turn would impact expected returns . context , mnre notified time extension provided renewable energy projects , impacted supply chain disruption due covid outbreak , force majeure clause . “ given execution headwinds amid covid 19 affecting q1 fy2020-21 assuming normalcy thereafter , capacity addition wind solar segments together likely degrow 25 % , thus estimated 8 gw earlier estimates 11 gw fy2020-21 , ” said kadam .
